            <p>03/August/2024 Tena, Ecuador
                As you can see in the photo I am holding a snake, I made this trip with
                my two brothers and my parents. That trip was like a kind of tour of the Amazon of Ecuador and this was
                one
                of the stops, here I swim in the river and we stayed in cottages which I absolutely loved.
                Also we did different activities like rafting, hiking, traditional dance,etc.

                I went on this trip with my mom and a cousin. It was one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever
                had, although it was also one of the most stressful due to the number of things that went wrong. Still,
                there was no shortage of laughter. Despite everything, we made wonderful memories together, and I also
                got to see one of the wonders of the world, which was simplyÂ beautiful.
