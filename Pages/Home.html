                I made this page with the goal of showing my future childrens what my life was like before they were
                born,
                not just through what others might tell them, also through something they could see for themselves
                and use to understand what my life was like, or at least how I see it from a different perspective.
                With nothing more to add, I hope you like it. It was made with lots of "Cariño"(Is an spanish word, do
                not translate it instead look for the meaning). :D</p>

                    Ecuador in the Sierra, therefore she grew up with 2 completely different types of mores, which she
                    loves and appreciates from her childhood</p>
